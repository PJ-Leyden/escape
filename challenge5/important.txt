So our friend Billy liked to make up his own language from modifying others....
He calls this one "gpi nLati" which pig latin but different. His rules for the language is:

1. the last letter must go to front of the word
2. and you must add "ay" to the front of each words

Example:
doing this in python would be easy
would become
aygdoin aysthi ayni aynpytho aydwoul ayeb ayyeas

Now, to get the answer for challenge 5, translate:

hacksu is a pretty cool

to  Billy's "gpi nLati" and remove the spaces.
